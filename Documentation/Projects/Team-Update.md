## 2026-05-11 — Phase 1.1 shipped: project scaffold + env validation

**Detail:** [`Phase-1.1-Summary.md`](./Phase-1.1-Summary.md) · [Phase folder](./Phases/Phase%201%20%E2%80%94%20Foundation/Phase%201.1%20%E2%80%94%20Project%20scaffold%20%2B%20env/)

**Headline:** The technical foundation is in place. Every subsequent phase plugs into this scaffold.

**What's new:**
- Next.js 15 App Router app with TypeScript strict mode and the `@/*` path alias.
- Tailwind v4 design tokens from mockup #01 baked into `app/globals.css` (`yt`, `ink`, `curiosity`, `fear`, `result` palettes plus shadows and the `.card`/`.glow-bg`/`.grid-bg`/`.pulse-dot` utilities). This is the locked visual contract every UI feature will inherit.
- `lib/env.ts` — Zod-validated env vars for all 7 required keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SITE_URL`). The app refuses to start on bad config.
- `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` and an in-app footer link satisfy CRIT-4 (MIT attribution for `AgriciDaniel/claude-youtube`) before any prompt code is written.
- ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, and the `pnpm dev`/`build`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`format` scripts.
- Reference repo cloned to `~/development/_reference/claude-youtube/` so Phase 2 can lift sub-skill prompt patterns under MIT.
- Reusable conversation-flow prompt templates under `prompts/` (start → focus → execute → document).

**How to run it locally:**
```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the 7 keys
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

**Heads up for the next contributor:**
- The trigger tokens (`curiosity`, `fear`, `result`) are single-step (`-500` only), matching mockup #01. If a stage needs more shades, extend `@theme` in `app/globals.css` — don't fork the trigger naming.
- `next lint` is deprecated in Next 16. We're on 15.5.x so it still works, but plan a migration before the upgrade.
- The reference repo's `sub-skills/` directory is actually at `skills/claude-youtube/sub-skills/`. A top-level symlink makes the documented path work; future per-prompt `// Adapted from sub-skills/<name>.md` comments resolve through it.

**What's next:** Phase 1.2 — Supabase project + schemas (channels, profiles, pipeline_runs, youtube_quota_usage, youtube_api_cache, onboard_drafts, login_attempts) with RLS on every user-scoped table.
